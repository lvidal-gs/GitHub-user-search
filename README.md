# GitHub User search

## Created for training my HTML, CSS and JS skills. :computer:

A simple project using a *GitHub's API*, that search an user through their objects' attributes provided by a JSON file, like:

username, repos nยบ, most used language (_not all of them_) in the project and etc, and show, visually, the user's information.

#### API's Links:

- https://api.github.com/users/'user' (_Show basic user informations_)
- https://api.github.com/users/'user'/repos (_Show the repo's_)


PS: You can use some parameters to increase the number of shown pages and how many repositories that you can *put* in the screen

Will be something like: https://api.github.com/users/'user'/repos__?page=1&per_page=1000__
